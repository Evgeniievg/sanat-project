      <p className='article__text'>"Assa" is a movie directed by Sergei Solovyov in 1986. The drama tells the story of a young girl named Alika who, in search of comfort, links her life with the criminal authority of Krymov. But suddenly Alika meets the young musician Bananan, and this meeting becomes truly fateful.</p>
      <p className='article__text'>Assa is one of the first important films of the perestroika era. It was created in conditions of loosening censorship and openness, allowing the discussion of state problems. The film presents the shadow side of Soviet society, with its inherent illegal entrepreneurship, banditry, corruption, and the lack of prospects for the young. Notable is the dialogue between Alika and Banan, in which the girl explains her decision to reconcile with Krymov.</p>
      <p className='article__text'>"Assa" wasn't the first Soviet film about gangsters, but it stands out because films with similar themes in previous eras were often comedies, such as "Gentlemen of Fortune" and "Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures," while "Assa" is a drama. The film has a talented cast, including Stanislav Govorukhin, who had already directed several films, and young Tatiana Druzhi, who shone in the early Solovev film "One Hundred Days After Childhood." The film also features Alexander Bashirov and cinematographer Pavel Lebeshev, who had worked on previous Solovev films.</p>

      <p className='article__text'>"Assa" is an exceptionally colorful film. In addition to picturesque landscapes of winter Yalta, the viewer can experience the unique setting of Banana's room (objects such as "communication pipe," "iron curtain," and others). All the items in Banana's room are actually the property of Sergei "Afrika" Bugaev. In the book "Assa and Other Works. Book 2," Solovyov writes: "All the items in the screen Banana's room - they were directly and unchanged moved from Afrika's apartment to the film: including the pig with a nose peeling off from the rubber of underwear, the ancient mask in a gas mask, the cash register with a thousand different items in it, Jokonda with whiskers, polyethylene curtains painted with all possible sprays, and everything else that was there... " Bugaev's works also appear in the film in the form of Banana's dream No. 1: bright abstract drawings replace each other, creating quirky shapes.</p>

      <p className='article__text'>"Assa" is a significant milestone in the history of Soviet rock music. The film's soundtrack is diverse and harmonious. The author and leader of the group "Aquarium", Boris Grebenshchikov, performed the soundtrack, and the film features the compositions "Mochalkin Blues", "Golden City", "I'm Coming to You", and others. The final scenes of the film also feature songs by the groups "Kino" and "Bravo." The closing chords of the film are performed by Viktor Tsoi with the song "Changes." As the director recalls, "The hall with blazing eyes... as the crowd wildly shouted along with Tsoi: 'We are waiting for change, change!' But change, it must be said, was still far away in that fragile evening. And it still did not smell of it seriously..."</p>

      <p className='article__text'>The film is also noteworthy for its use of the "film within a film" technique, depicting fragments from Nathan Aidelman's book "The Edge of Time," which tells the story of the murder of Emperor Paul I. According to the plot, the book is being read by Andrei Krymov himself. The parallel is obvious: the fate of the emperor is somehow echoed the events happening to the characters in "Assa." It is noteworthy that the text is read by the author himself, Aidelman.</p>

      <p className='article__text'>In addition, it is worth mentioning the name of the picture. In the work "Assa and other works. Book 1," Soloviev remembered: "At five o'clock in the morning, someone loudly knocked on the door of my room." It was Sergei Bugaev, who after asking "Do you want the film to be successful?" started convincing the director of the need to name the film "Assa." "Africa" said that the word was related to Noah's Ark, but he didn't elaborate at such an early hour. Later, when Soloviev demanded an explanation of the meaning of the title on the set, he answered: "It doesn't mean anything. Well, if you really need to, you can understand it this way: "Author Soloviev Sergei Alexandrovich."</p>
