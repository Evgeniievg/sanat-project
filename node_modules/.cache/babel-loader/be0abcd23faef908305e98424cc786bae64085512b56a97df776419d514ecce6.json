He is widely considered to be one of the greatest Netherlandish painters of the sixteenth century and is known for his landscapes, allegorical scenes, and genre paintings.</p>\n      <div className='image__container'>\n        <img src={breugelPort} className='article__image'/>\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Spring Walk on the Mountain Path (山徑春行) (Imperial Palace Museum, Taiwan)</span>\n      </div>\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel was born in Breda, Netherlands and later settled in Antwerp, where he became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke. He is thought to have studied under the artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and later traveled to Italy, where he was influenced by the work of the Renaissance painters. This influence is evident in his use of color, light, and perspective, as well as his depiction of landscape and genre scenes. Trip to Italy had a profound influence on his work, and he began incorporating elements of Renaissance style into his paintings upon his return to Antwerp.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel married the daughter of the prominent Flemish painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and had two sons, Pieter the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder, who were both successful artists in their own right.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel is most famous for his landscape paintings, which feature scenes of the Flemish countryside and the lives of the people who lived there. He was one of the first artists to focus on landscapes as the subject of his paintings, and his works are known for their intricate details, vivid colors, and lifelike scenes.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to his landscapes, Bruegel is also known for his allegorical and genre paintings. These works often feature scenes from everyday life, such as weddings, harvest festivals, and peasant dances. He used these scenes to comment on contemporary issues, such as poverty, famine, and religious conflict.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>Throughout his career, Bruegel received numerous commissions for paintings from wealthy patrons, and his works were highly sought after for their realism, intricate details, and vivid colors. He was a prolific artist, and is estimated to have created over 40 paintings and over 60 drawings in his lifetime.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>One of Bruegel's most famous works is \"The Tower of Babel,\" which was painted in 1563. It was created in 1563 and depicts the biblical story of the tower built by the people of Babel in an attempt to reach the heavens. The painting shows the massive tower surrounded by a bustling cityscape, with people of all walks of life going about their daily business.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>In the painting, the tower reaches towards the heavens and is depicted as an impressive structure, but it is also shown as being incomplete, with the workers struggling to finish it. This has been interpreted as a commentary on the futility of human ambition and the dangers of pride.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>The cityscape in the painting is full of life, with people of all ages and professions depicted in intricate detail. Bruegel's use of color, light, and perspective creates a lively, realistic scene, and his attention to detail is apparent in the depiction of the city's buildings, animals, and other elements.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to the biblical story, \"The Tower of Babel\" has also been interpreted as a commentary on the religious conflict and division of Bruegel's time. The painting shows people of different nationalities, languages, and beliefs working together to build the tower, but their ambition and pride eventually lead to its downfall.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>Today, \"The Tower of Babel\" is considered one of Bruegel's greatest works and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Renaissance art. It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and continues to captivate audiences with its intricate details and powerful allegorical message.</p>\n      <div className='image__container'>\n        <img src={breugelPort} className='article__image'/>\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Spring Walk on the Mountain Path (山徑春行) (Imperial Palace Museum, Taiwan)</span>\n      </div>\n      <p className='article__text'>One of Bruegel's most famous landscapes is \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,\" which was painted in 1558. This painting features a vivid depiction of the countryside, with a large, bustling landscape in the foreground and a mountainous background. The focal point of the painting is the small figure of Icarus, who has fallen into the sea after flying too close to the sun with his wings made of wax. The scene is almost overlooked by the people in the foreground, who are going about their daily business and seemingly unaware of the tragedy that has occurred.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>This painting has been interpreted in a number of different ways, with some seeing it as a commentary on human ambition and the dangers of overreaching, while others view it as a representation of the transience of life and the inevitability of death.

It is one of his most famous works and depicts the Biblical story of King Herod's order to kill all male infants in Bethlehem in an attempt to kill the baby Jesus. The painting shows the massacre taking place against the backdrop of a Netherlandish village, with villagers going about their daily activities in the foreground. Bruegel's use of a contemporary setting and everyday activities in the painting serves to underscore the cruelty and inhumanity of the massacre. The painting is notable for its vivid depiction of violence and its powerful social commentary, and it remains one of Bruegel's most well-known works today.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>\"Massacre of the Innocents\" is a large oil-on-panel painting, measuring approximately 110 x 164 cm. The painting shows the massacre taking place in the center, with soldiers wielding swords and mothers desperately trying to protect their children. To the left of the scene, villagers can be seen fleeing in panic, while to the right, others are shown going about their business indifferently. This contrast between the horror of the massacre and the indifference of the villagers serves to amplify the painting's social commentary.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel's use of light and color in the painting is also noteworthy. The massacre scene is depicted in dark, shadowy tones, while the background and foreground are bathed in bright light. This contrast serves to emphasize the violence of the massacre and makes it stand out from the peaceful, everyday activities of the villagers.</p>\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to its artistic and historical importance, \"Massacre of the Innocents\" is also significant for its symbolic meaning.
