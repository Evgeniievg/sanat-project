The drama tells the story of a young girl named Alika who, in search of comfort, links her life with the criminal authority of Krymov. But suddenly Alika meets the young musician Bananan, and this meeting becomes truly fateful.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Assa is one of the first important films of the perestroika era. It was created in conditions of loosening censorship and openness, allowing the discussion of state problems. The film presents the shadow side of Soviet society, with its inherent illegal entrepreneurship, banditry, corruption, and the lack of prospects for the young. Notable is the dialogue between Alika and Banan, in which the girl explains her decision to reconcile with Krymov.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>\"Assa\" wasn't the first Soviet film about gangsters, but it stands out because films with similar themes in previous eras were often comedies, such as \"Gentlemen of Fortune\" and \"Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures,\" while \"Assa\" is a drama. The film has a talented cast, including Stanislav Govorukhin, who had already directed several films, and young Tatiana Druzhi, who shone in the early Solovev film \"One Hundred Days After Childhood.\" The film also features Alexander Bashirov and cinematographer Pavel Lebeshev, who had worked on previous Solovev films.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={assaFirst} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Tatyana Drubich on the set of \"Assa\"</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>\"Assa\" is an exceptionally colorful film. In addition to picturesque landscapes of winter Yalta, the viewer can experience the unique setting of Banana's room (objects such as \"communication pipe,\" \"iron curtain,\" and others). All the items in Banana's room are actually the property of Sergei \"Afrika\" Bugaev. In the book \"Assa and Other Works. Book 2,\" Solovyov writes: \"All the items in the screen Banana's room - they were directly and unchanged moved from Afrika's apartment to the film: including the pig with a nose peeling off from the rubber of underwear, the ancient mask in a gas mask, the cash register with a thousand different items in it, Jokonda with whiskers, polyethylene curtains painted with all possible sprays, and everything else that was there... \" Bugaev's works also appear in the film in the form of Banana's dream No. 1: bright abstract drawings replace each other, creating quirky shapes.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={assaSecond} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Sergey Bugaev, Tatyana Drubich and Dmitry Shumilov on the set of \"Assa\"</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>\"Assa\" is a significant milestone in the history of Soviet rock music. The film's soundtrack is diverse and harmonious. The author and leader of the group \"Aquarium\", Boris Grebenshchikov, performed the soundtrack, and the film features the compositions \"Mochalkin Blues\", \"Golden City\", \"I'm Coming to You\", and others. The final scenes of the film also feature songs by the groups \"Kino\" and \"Bravo.\" The closing chords of the film are performed by Viktor Tsoi with the song \"Changes.\" As the director recalls, \"The hall with blazing eyes... as the crowd wildly shouted along with Tsoi: 'We are waiting for change, change!' But change, it must be said, was still far away in that fragile evening. And it still did not smell of it seriously...\"</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={assaThird} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Sergey Bugaev on the set of \"Assya\"</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>The film is also noteworthy for its use of the \"film within a film\" technique, depicting fragments from Nathan Aidelman's book \"The Edge of Time,\" which tells the story of the murder of Emperor Paul I. According to the plot, the book is being read by Andrei Krymov himself. The parallel is obvious: the fate of the emperor is somehow echoed the events happening to the characters in \"Assa.\" It is noteworthy that the text is read by the author himself, Aidelman.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={assaFour} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Sergey Bugaev on the set of \"Assya\"</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition, it is worth mentioning the name of the picture. In the work \"Assa and other works.

Born into a family of famous artists, Ma Yuan was able to not only inherit the pictorial traditions of his ancestors, but also make a significant contribution to the development of Chinese painting. Ma Yuan lived during a time of great upheaval: in 1127, he was forced to move to Lin'an (Hangzhou) with the Imperial Court and the Academy of Painting because the Jurchen (a people who lived in X-XV century in northeast China) had captured the northern part of the country and the capital of Kaifeng as a result of a series of prolonged wars. From now on, the theme of nostalgia and longing for the past life was traced in all his works.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Despite the fact that the figure of a person is rarely seen in the artist's work, the lyricism of the plot is quite clear. In terms of lyricism, Ma Yuan's painting can be compared to Sung poetry.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={maYuanFirst} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Spring Walk on the Mountain Path (山徑春行) (Imperial Palace Museum, Taiwan)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In Ma Yuan's works, great importance was attached to the person and his feelings. In the artist's pictorial compositions, the viewer will not find a reflection of the former majesty and grandeur of the Under heaven with its high mountains and flowing rivers, but will feel the sadness and melancholy that pervaded the artist's life and work.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>The landscape motifs used by the artist conveyed the inner state of the lyrical hero. One of the frequent motifs in Ma Yuan's works was the unity of man and nature, which is evident, in particular, in the painting \"Scholar with his servant on a mountain terrace\".</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={maYuanScientist} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Scholar with His Servant on a Mountain Terrace (松溪观鹿图) (New York)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={maYuanFisherman} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Lone Fisherman on the Frozen River (寒江独钩图) (National Museum, Tokyo)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Ma Yuan was known as \"Ma of One Corner\" because his favorite compositional technique was to concentrate the image in one corner, leaving the majority of the painting empty, allowing the viewer to imagine the scene. He used a lot of \"air\" to create a mysterious and appealing atmosphere. The foreground in Ma Yuan's paintings is more open than in previous eras, allowing the viewer to \"enter\" the painting and feel close to the lyrical hero. In depicting rock textures, Ma Yuan often used the \"splitting of a big ax\" technique, which is clearly visible in \"Dance and Song\". Ma Yuan and his contemporary Xia Gui were considered a new milestone in the development of national painting during their lifetime and their style was later named Ma-Xia.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={maYuanWildlife} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Wild Plums, Stones, Creek, and Ducks (梅石溪凫图) (Gugun Museum, Beijing)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Yes, Ma Yuan was known to use the \"big axe hack\" (大斧劈) technique to create the texture of rocks in his landscapes.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest Netherlandish painters of the sixteenth century and is known for his landscapes, allegorical scenes, and genre paintings.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={breugelPort} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Spring Walk on the Mountain Path (山徑春行) (Imperial Palace Museum, Taiwan)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel was born in Breda, Netherlands and later settled in Antwerp, where he became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke. He is thought to have studied under the artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and later traveled to Italy, where he was influenced by the work of the Renaissance painters. This influence is evident in his use of color, light, and perspective, as well as his depiction of landscape and genre scenes. Trip to Italy had a profound influence on his work, and he began incorporating elements of Renaissance style into his paintings upon his return to Antwerp.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel married the daughter of the prominent Flemish painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and had two sons, Pieter the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder, who were both successful artists in their own right.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel is most famous for his landscape paintings, which feature scenes of the Flemish countryside and the lives of the people who lived there. He was one of the first artists to focus on landscapes as the subject of his paintings, and his works are known for their intricate details, vivid colors, and lifelike scenes.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to his landscapes, Bruegel is also known for his allegorical and genre paintings. These works often feature scenes from everyday life, such as weddings, harvest festivals, and peasant dances. He used these scenes to comment on contemporary issues, such as poverty, famine, and religious conflict.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Throughout his career, Bruegel received numerous commissions for paintings from wealthy patrons, and his works were highly sought after for their realism, intricate details, and vivid colors. He was a prolific artist, and is estimated to have created over 40 paintings and over 60 drawings in his lifetime.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>One of Bruegel's most famous works is \"The Tower of Babel,\" which was painted in 1563. It was created in 1563 and depicts the biblical story of the tower built by the people of Babel in an attempt to reach the heavens. The painting shows the massive tower surrounded by a bustling cityscape, with people of all walks of life going about their daily business.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In the painting, the tower reaches towards the heavens and is depicted as an impressive structure, but it is also shown as being incomplete, with the workers struggling to finish it. This has been interpreted as a commentary on the futility of human ambition and the dangers of pride.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>The cityscape in the painting is full of life, with people of all ages and professions depicted in intricate detail. Bruegel's use of color, light, and perspective creates a lively, realistic scene, and his attention to detail is apparent in the depiction of the city's buildings, animals, and other elements.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to the biblical story, \"The Tower of Babel\" has also been interpreted as a commentary on the religious conflict and division of Bruegel's time. The painting shows people of different nationalities, languages, and beliefs working together to build the tower, but their ambition and pride eventually lead to its downfall.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Today, \"The Tower of Babel\" is considered one of Bruegel's greatest works and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Renaissance art.

This painting features a vivid depiction of the countryside, with a large, bustling landscape in the foreground and a mountainous background. The focal point of the painting is the small figure of Icarus, who has fallen into the sea after flying too close to the sun with his wings made of wax. The scene is almost overlooked by the people in the foreground, who are going about their daily business and seemingly unaware of the tragedy that has occurred.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>This painting has been interpreted in a number of different ways, with some seeing it as a commentary on human ambition and the dangers of overreaching, while others view it as a representation of the transience of life and the inevitability of death. Whatever the interpretation, \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" is widely considered one of Bruegel's greatest works and is an example of his mastery of landscape painting.</p>\r\n      <div className='image__container'>\r\n        <img src={breugelIkar} className='article__image'/>\r\n        <span className='image__subtext'>Spring Walk on the Mountain Path (山徑春行) (Imperial Palace Museum, Taiwan)</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel's \"Flight into Egypt\" is notable for its naturalistic depiction of the landscape, which includes rolling hills, rocky cliffs, and a winding river. The sky is cloudy, and the scene is lit by a warm, golden light, which creates a sense of peacefulness and tranquility. The Holy Family is shown in the foreground.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In this painting, Bruegel used his characteristic realistic style to create a vivid and lifelike depiction of the biblical story. He used subtle details and careful attention to light and shadow to create a sense of depth and dimensionality in the scene. He also used his knowledge of human anatomy and clothing to create a sense of movement and action in the composition, as the travelers make their way across the rugged landscape.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Today, \"The Flight into Egypt\" is considered one of Bruegel's greatest works and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Renaissance art.

The foreground of the painting is filled with a diverse cast of characters, including mourners, soldiers, and onlookers, all of whom seem deeply affected by the events unfolding before them.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>One of the key elements of the painting is the sense of movement and energy, with people and animals flowing in different directions throughout the composition. Bruegel's masterful use of light and color adds to the sense of depth and realism in the painting, creating a vivid and powerful image.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>\"The Procession to Calvary\" is considered one of Bruegel's greatest works, and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Renaissance art.

It is one of his most famous works and depicts the Biblical story of King Herod's order to kill all male infants in Bethlehem in an attempt to kill the baby Jesus. The painting shows the massacre taking place against the backdrop of a Netherlandish village, with villagers going about their daily activities in the foreground. Bruegel's use of a contemporary setting and everyday activities in the painting serves to underscore the cruelty and inhumanity of the massacre. The painting is notable for its vivid depiction of violence and its powerful social commentary, and it remains one of Bruegel's most well-known works today.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>\"Massacre of the Innocents\" is a large oil-on-panel painting, measuring approximately 110 x 164 cm. The painting shows the massacre taking place in the center, with soldiers wielding swords and mothers desperately trying to protect their children. To the left of the scene, villagers can be seen fleeing in panic, while to the right, others are shown going about their business indifferently. This contrast between the horror of the massacre and the indifference of the villagers serves to amplify the painting's social commentary.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>Bruegel's use of light and color in the painting is also noteworthy. The massacre scene is depicted in dark, shadowy tones, while the background and foreground are bathed in bright light. This contrast serves to emphasize the violence of the massacre and makes it stand out from the peaceful, everyday activities of the villagers.</p>\r\n      <p className='article__text'>In addition to its artistic and historical importance, \"Massacre of the Innocents\" is also significant for its symbolic meaning.
